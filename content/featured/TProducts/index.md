# CD, OBD , RFID

When I was working in it, I found out that there is a flaw in logging user , where the security comes to play a crucial part. I have intergrated with aws s3 container to make sure the company has no vulnerable threats in logging the customer.
In addition to that these platform organize all the services used in tekion to come together so that we have unique one way login portal for all the customers without being checked for each time for any threats.

# Text Editor (Tekion – Full Time)

Here , In this one I have created a library for internal tekion to use Text Editor using prosemirror where any front End Developer can use the library to get input data from the user.
In simple Terms, It is basically online Microsoft word editor where user can enter any text and attach documents , videos , photos, they can use markdown standards to document their Process. It has increased all products efficiency by 10% across Tekion.

# PDM – Parts Delivery Management (Tekion - Full Time)

This is an webpage for the user to keep track of their orders like amazon sales. In Simpler Terms, The user can interact with mapbox to click the customer order, from they they can group numerous orders to create a route through the day for the fleet driver to deliver it.
In addition to it I have created a mobile app, where the company can keep track of their fleet drivers and can update the customer.
An expiration link was sent to the customer to get the updated location of the fleet and their order. Once the order delivers the link gets expired.
